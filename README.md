# **Nephros: Kidney Disease Detection**

## **Overview**
Nephros is a machine learning project designed to classify kidney diseases using CT scan images. It focuses on identifying the following conditions:
- **Normal kidneys**
- **Kidneys with cysts**
- **Kidneys with tumors**
- **Kidneys with stones**

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to biomedical image analysis, providing an effective solution for kidney disease detection.

## **Features**
- Preprocessing of CT scan images for model readiness.
- Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- Evaluation of the model’s performance on the test set.
- Insights for improving kidney disease detection models.
